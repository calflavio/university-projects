These jupyter notebooks were developed for the Computational Astrophysics exam of the master's degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology @ UniPD.
The project (in group of 3) was to apply machine learning algorithms to classify three-body encounters of black holes. The dataset was unbalanced and previous work suggested
that it was not possible to achieve high accuracy since it is a physical problem with intrinsic chaoticness.

We applied a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN notebook) with Keras and a Balanced Random Forest (RF and RF2 notebooks) with Scikit-learn.
